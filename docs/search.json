I currently work as a customer solutions specialist in the flexible packaging industry. Even though I graduated from the engineering department, my current job is unrelated to engineering or data science. I am very excited to start this master’s degree and with the big data analytics program, my goal is to improve my knowledge in this area, develop new skills, and I plan to have a career change in the future. I believe I can combine my customer knowledge on my current job with CRM analytics.\nHere you may find my Linkedin Account\nhttps://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/talks/quarto-for-rmarkdown-users/?wvideo=moj4859n2g\nThe session “Quarto for the Curios” was held by Tom Mock who is the Customer Enablement Lead at RStudio. He defines Quarto as the next generation of R markdown. He describes the workflow of Rmarkdown then moves to the workflow of Quarto and mentions about the similarities, differences and advantages that Quarto brings. To use Rmarkdown we need R but to use Quarto are not only limited with R. With Quarto we can prepare the same documents with different programming languages like Python, Julia or Javascript. Tom mentions how to create interactive document by using html widgets, shiny or Jupyter widgets by using them in an quarto document. He closes his conference talk by giving credits to the development team ."

Grammar of graphics framework was introduced by Leland Wilkinson .\nYou may find more detailed information on Grammar of Graphics in the below link:\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-grammar-of-graphics-for-effective-visualization-of-multi-dimensional-1f92b4ed4149\nThe easiest way to get ggplot2 in R is to install the whole tidyverse:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nBuilding Blocks of layers with the grammar of graphics\n\nData\nAesthetics\nLayers\nScales\nCoordinates\nFacets\nThemes\n\n\n4.2.1 Box Plot:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ntheme_set(theme_classic())\n\n# Plot\ng <- ggplot(mpg, aes(class, cty))\ng + geom_boxplot(varwidth=T, fill=\"plum\") + \n    labs(title=\"Box plot\", \n         subtitle=\"City Mileage grouped by Class of vehicle\",\n         caption=\"Source: mpg\",\n         x=\"Class of Vehicle\",\n         y=\"City Mileage\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Bubble Chart :\n\n# load package and data\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndata(mpg, package=\"ggplot2\")\n# mpg <- read.csv(\"http://goo.gl/uEeRGu\")\n\nmpg_select <- mpg[mpg$manufacturer %in% c(\"audi\", \"ford\", \"honda\", \"hyundai\"), ]\n\n# Scatterplot\ntheme_set(theme_bw())  # pre-set the bw theme.\ng <- ggplot(mpg_select, aes(displ, cty)) + \n  labs(subtitle=\"mpg: Displacement vs City Mileage\",\n       title=\"Bubble chart\")\n\ng + geom_jitter(aes(col=manufacturer, size=hwy)) + \n  geom_smooth(aes(col=manufacturer), method=\"lm\", se=F)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Histogram on a categorical variable :\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ntheme_set(theme_classic())\n\n# Histogram on a Categorical variable\ng <- ggplot(mpg, aes(manufacturer))\ng + geom_bar(aes(fill=class), width = 0.5) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=65, vjust=0.6)) + \n  labs(title=\"Histogram on Categorical Variable\", \n       subtitle=\"Manufacturer across Vehicle Classes\")"

It splits the data into two halves. If the number of elements in the data set is odd then the center element is median and if it is even then the median would be the average of two central elements.\nSyntax for calculating median in R:\nmedian(x, na.rm = FALSE)\n3-Mode: Mode is the value that has highest number of occurrences in a set of data. Unike mean and median, mode can have both numeric and character data.R does not have a standard in-built function to calculate mode. A function is created below to calculate mode of a data set in R. This function takes the vector as input and gives the mode value as output.\n\n#Create the mode function\n\ngetmode <- function(v) {\n   uniqv <- unique(v)\n   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]\n}\n\n# Create the vector with numbers.\nv <- c(2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,1,5,5,3,2,3)\n\n# Calculate the mode using the user function.\nresult <- getmode(v)\nprint(result)\n\n[1] 2\n\n# Create the vector with characters.\ncharv <- c(\"o\",\"it\",\"the\",\"it\",\"it\")\n\n# Calculate the mode using the user function.\nresult <- getmode(charv)\nprint(result)\n\n[1] \"it\"\n\n\nSource: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_mean_median_mode.htm"
